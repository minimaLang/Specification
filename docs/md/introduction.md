## Motivation

I had been thinking about developing my own programming language for some time. \
I had made attempts before, but never really realised them. \
Now it should be different.

The reason for the light syntax and the minimalist function is \
that I want to build on this programming language. \
Mainly as an intermediate language.

## Goal

I **want to** ...

1. a simple, minimalistic, syntax
2. with minimalistic function
   - with little syntax sugar, if needed (see 3.)
3. easy to understand, easy to learn

## No-Goal

I do **not want** to ...

- write an all-purposes programming language
